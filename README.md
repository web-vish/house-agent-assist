# Lets Get Started - Agent Assist Application

## Information
This Project is skill demonstration project and I have successfully recreated some of the functionalities of popular property management website that is widely used in UK.
As part of the demonstration, I have included best practices of React that are used to build large high demand application that are serving millions of users across the world. 

### Technical Stack

ReactJS
Create React App
React Query
Axios

### Techniques

1. Atomic Design standards for components for scalable and maintainable code base. 
2. React Query for better handle API requests and enable caching at client for faster response. 



### How to run the App

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder. 
2. `npm i`
3. `npx json-server db/db.json`
    This will start the json server at port 3000.
4. `npm run start`
    This will start the application at port 3001 or any free port that is available. 



#### Note
1. This project is for demonstration purpose only.
2. This App is not production ready and if ports are not available, some error are expected.
